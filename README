greatest width word: 12 letters
each letter is 25 things ...
delegate 5 bits for a letter [1,26]
that means ... still just one per 8-bits ...
that might as well be 1 byte per letter.
so 12.  12 is 4 RGB's wide.

whats our height going to be?
80611
requires 967,332 bytes total if we have 1-byte per letter
requires 20 RGB textures of size 4x4096
if we were to interleave results though ...
like (4*1024)x4096 ... 
then we could hold 1024*4096 = 4,194,304 words per texture
we could hold all our words in one texture.
we could likewise do that for smaller textures ... like
65,536 < 131,072 = 256 * 512
so we could hold our words in a (256*4) x 512 texture,
or 1024 x 512

then render to a result the size of 256 x 512
we could load the 4-rgb word as a set of uniforms (slowdown?)
then do the render pass,
reading words as 4-rgb texel lookups, subtract-comparing them,
and writing the sum-squared-difference to the output.

then, like einstein, we can have the cpu cycle through the results
and see if any are zero.  those are the matches.

...

so first we cycle through all
